Code to get better at Python

This is my first Github project.  I'm just looking to post up some code that is helpful for getting started, and getting better at coding Python.  This will, at least initially, be a hodge podge of snippets I've found on the web, but then hopefully morph into something more personal.  

For now, it is what it is...
